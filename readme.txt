Displays a stylish Post Formats panel on your sidebar.

== Description ==

The WP Post Formats Widget creates a stylish, practical panel that displays all of the available post formats on your site with attached counters and links to the respective post formats' archives. It can used on almost any sidebar, giving direct access to all of those special posts. If you use the post formats feature on your site, this widget will enhance their functionality. If not then it's time to start using them.

2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. Go to the widgets screen, and drag the Post Formats Widget to your sidebar.
4. Check the result and adjust the number of columns in the widget settings accordingly.


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why when I click a link on the widget, I get a 404 Error page? =

You must change the permalinks settings in the administration section of your site from default to any of the other choices (nice permalink structure required).

= What is the use of 'Number of Columns' on widget settings? =

It lets you better adapt the widget to your theme by setting the number of the elements to show per row. Set it according to the space available on your sidebar. Ideally each element should occupy a space of 60 to 80 pixels in width, but that depends also from the base font size.
